# Related Modals
In Django Smartbase Admin, related models can be managed directly from within a parent model form using Related Modals.

These are modal dialogs that open inline (without using iframe),
allowing users to either view or create related objects without leaving the current page.

If there is a registered sbadmin view for the related model (e.g. Manufacturer) and the user has the appropriate permissions,
action buttons will appear next to the related field:

## Controlling Visibility of Related Buttons
The visibility of these buttons is controlled by the method:

```python
def autocomplete_show_related_buttons(
    self,
    related_model,
    field_name,
    current_view,
    request,
) -> bool:
    return not is_modal(request)
```

This method is defined in `SBAdminRoleConfiguration` and can be overridden in your custom [🔗configuration class](/docs/installation#3-define-the-smartbase-admin-configuration) to provide custom control.

### 💡 Example: Hide related buttons for specific models
```python
def autocomplete_show_related_buttons(
    self,
    related_model,
    field_name,
    current_view,
    request,
) -> bool:
    # Hide related buttons for specific models
    if related_model.__name__ in ["User","Group"]:
        return False
    return super().autocomplete_show_related_buttons(
        related_model, field_name, current_view, request
    )
```
