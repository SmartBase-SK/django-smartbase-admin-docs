In addition to foreign key fields, Django SmartBase Admin also supports modals for inline models.

By default, clicking the “Add” button in a table inline simply inserts a new row directly into the inline formset.
However, if you set the `sb_admin_add_modal` attribute to `True` in your inline definition:

```python
class ProductImageInline(SBAdminTableInline):
    ...
    sb_admin_add_modal = True
```
The "Add" button will open a modal dialog instead of inserting a blank row. This allows users to create a related object using a full form layout with validation, without leaving the current context.

:::warning
The inline's model must have its own `SBAdmin` view registered with `sb_admin_site`. The modal uses the registered admin's change form to render the creation dialog. Without a registered admin, the modal URL cannot be resolved and will result in a `NoReverseMatch` error.
